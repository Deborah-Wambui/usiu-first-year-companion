Purpose of the Wireframe
The wireframe provides a structured blueprint of the website layout. It allows planning of content placement and user flow before implementing the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures consistency, readability, and a user-friendly design.

Home Page Wireframe
The homepage wireframe includes:
- A header with the project title for clear identification.  
- A greeting message and short description to introduce the site’s purpose.  
- Two main buttons: **Run Estimator** and **Toggle Theme**, placed prominently for ease of use.  
- A weekly summary section to display results from the estimator.  
- A footer with a simple credit line.  

The layout is minimal and functional, with clear separation of sections.

Interaction with JavaScript
JavaScript is used to add interactivity:  
1.Run Estimator – generates and displays a weekly study plan in the summary section.  
2.Toggle Theme – switches between light and dark mode, while ensuring text color changes for readability.  

These interactions transform the page from static content into a responsive, interactive tool.
